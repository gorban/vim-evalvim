Why do you need it?

Well, most probably you don't need this plugin. ;)

I find it useful for:

    * making other vim plugins -- write vimscript anywhere, eval/run it, see
      the result;
	* check vimrc settings or plugin settings I do occasionally install.


MAPPINGS                                                    *evalvim-mappings*

There are no default mappings, create your own.


*<Plug>(EvalVim)*

In normal mode is an operator. It starts |operator-pending-mode|
where you can specify a motion to evaluate with (evaluate text objects and
motions).

In visual mode evaluates selection.

Example mappings:
>
    xmap <leader>v <Plug>(EvalVim)
    nmap <leader>v <Plug>(EvalVim)
    omap <leader>v <Plug>(EvalVim)

Put the cursor somewhere in the function

	fun! HelloFunc()
		:smile
	endfu

press '<leader>vap' to evaluate it. As a result you will have 'HelloFunc'
created. To call it, either run the command from |Cmdline|, or evaluate with
'<leader>vap':

	:call HelloFunc()

you should see smile generated by vim.

Now go change the function and re-evaluate it. :)


*<Plug>(EvalVimLine)*

Evaluate current vimscript line.

Example mappings:
>
    nmap <leader>vv <Plug>(EvalVimLine)
